# myHelloWorld
My GitHub "Hello World" tutorial

My name: Camille (aka fyrfli)
Date: 9-May-2019

I am an IT veteran with 15 years experience in programming, system, and database administration.

A series of life-altering events put me on a different path and I am now a social worker with a degree in intercultural communication and an interest in social studies. Now that I will be working with people, I have re-discovered my love of code and coding and now administer my own "homelab" as well as a few websites hosted on popular a virtual machine provider.

I am learning code versioning with this project. I have a few private projects but I want to know more and maybe someday be able to contribute to other projects.

Hello world!

Would it be corny to actually add an actual snippet of code that displays "Hello World" to this project? Corny ... maybe; fun? definitely.
